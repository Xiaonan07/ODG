# ODG: Omics Database Generator / UTR-import

## Introduction

Welcome. This is a project still in heavy development. Please follow this project for announcements or e-mail me (guhli007 at umn.edu) and ask to be mailed when the initial release is out.

## What this does

This program takes genome files and output from various programs to create a graph database for querying genomic data across domains. Currently the program is stable, but still undergoing development and some minor data structure changes.

Feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.

## Usage

Download and run appropriate programs to create the output. Please see run-new.sh to see what types of files are necessary.

./run.sh
./run-new.sh
